### 1. Don't take over the game

Unfortunately a lot of great mods assume the player likes to play with this mod only. This server stands for diversity. That means if a player does not like an included mod, they can play the game without using that mod (few exceptions).

### 2. Don't take over the server

Thinking alongside point 1, the mod should be not strain the server if the mod is not in use. That means no unnecessary ABM's and so on.

### 3. Don't destroy the world

The mod should not be able to destroy players' work.

### 4. No bad code quality

I look into the lua code of each mod before I make my decision. I'm tolerant against imperfect code, but roughly negligent and/or bad code will be rejected.

### 5. No cheating mods

The mods should not feel like cheats. The tools should be worn, walking through the world and searching for rare items should not be made obsolete by item generators.

### 6. Mod must not be incompatible with other mods

Mods should not require compatibility code to be added to the server, and thus requiring extra maintenance work on our part. If we find incompatibilities (ex. recipes conflicts, redundant items, keypress overlap) we expect any required changes to happen upstream before the mod is added to Archtec. Some exceptions may be considered on a case-by-case basis (few exceptions).

### 7. The code and artwork for the mod must be under a compatible licence

We only accept FOSS licenses. See [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html).
